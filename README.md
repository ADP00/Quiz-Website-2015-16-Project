# Quiz-Website-2015-16-Project
This project is an attempt to recreate an assignment from the 2015-16 school year. This was done as a refresher on js and html. The quiz file is read in and each question is displayed in a div one at a time. Not all the images are displayed because the urls were found during the orignal project and have become outdated.

To run the website, simply open the html file in a browser that supports JavaScript, and when prompted to choose the quiz.txt file.
